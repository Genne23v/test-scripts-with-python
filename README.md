#### \*This is my practice from LinkedIn Learning - Scripting for Testers. All scripts are written in Python. The scripts are to run HTTP request, creating a report using Google Spreadsheet API, Selenium UI test, and combined complex test cases.

### Download Python REST API Dependencies

```
python -m pip install requests
```

### Download Google Sheets

To use Google Spreadsheets, create Service Account and add it to spreadsheet. And add secret key file to working directory.

```
python -m pip install gspread
```

### Download Google API Client

```
python -m pip install google-api-python-client
```

### Download Selenium

```
python -m pip install selenium
```
